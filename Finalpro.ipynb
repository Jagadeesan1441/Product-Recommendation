My biggest mistake was choosing the OP 12R over the Nothing 2. Now, I regret it deeply. This phone frequently drops frames, even during TDM in BGMI. Sometimes, a portion of the screen freezes during gaming and regular usage. New feature such as heating issue, screen freezing, and a significant 5% battery drain overnight during idle periods.   \n",

The phone body is slick and the curved display, along with the brightness and sharp display makes it more sublime , the processor is super fast! And fast charging is damn well, charged it within a few minutes from 0-100%, Camera is okayish.   \n",

One word is a fabulous device which meets all my needs It has good network connectivity, great camera and smooth performance. Also moto promised to provide five years of software update but still not get anything from their sides. I am a moderate user and not playing any game on my device for me battery lasts about 1.5 days easily.   \n",

My previous 2 phones were OnePlus and seriously considered OP12 as well, but the AI features stood out. Phone software is well optimised and battery lasts me full day fully.

       "668                                    I purchased this for my wife for the reason one very well understand. I personally using S-22 ultra so I don't find i-phone as compatible and user friendly as other Android phones. Camera and Video quality may be good but with little difference as compared to other premium Android phones. Data transfer from Android to i-phone is not at all easy as claimed by Apple. Overall I still think it's a show off phone with this price one can have other premium phones in Android with loaded features.   \n",

You can't change manual time, Location. and no call recording option no free app on apple store for record call. but only Cinematic and portrait camera is just good. Others camera not good.

This is my first Samsung phone and I am very impressed. The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch.

Other than that it remains true to its flagship tag as display, battery, performance are all highly satisfactory. Camera is top notch. Since I have used mobiles from many brands, I rate one UI the best of all in the Android world. It's a wonderful all round device by Samsung . Special thanks to Flipkart for the big discount. I am extremely impressed with the product.   \n",

       "1111                                             Everything is much better when you think you got something better. But the real question is. Did i get something better?\\nI mean guys 26k for this. Nope\\nIf there happened to be a charger brick so that i could save 3k or else if i had known I'd have gone with something actually better.\\nPerformance - average\\nCamera - I don't know. Narzo 10 was better\\nBattery - depends on its mood\\nDisplay - good for watching study material\\nBuild - more like plastic\\nVibration is quite good. 🤙👍   \n",
