Flipkart Product Recommendation using Sentiment Analysis & LangChain
      This project automates the extraction, analysis, and recommendation of Flipkart products based on customer reviews.
      Using web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium), it collects reviews, processes them with NLP-based sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob, or BERT),
      and generates AI-driven product recommendations using LangChain. The insights are visualized using Pandas & Matplotlib, and the system is deployed on AWS (EC2, Flask/FastAPI)
      for live access. The project enhances skills in web scraping, data processing, NLP, and cloud deployment.
