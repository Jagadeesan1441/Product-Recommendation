vivo-t3-ultra,"Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.

After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags.
The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally.
The cameras are really good with detail...

Great phone at this price, only issue is overheating and slight low battery.

Pros - Everything else is great, except:

This may be a concern especially during summers.

redmi-note-13-pro-5g,"Writing a review after almost 2 weeks of usage. Bought this phone after almost 3 months of research. I am really happy with this phone, as it has everything in it at a good price. Design, display, camera and performance is as per my expectation. Battery back is good. I don't play games much so I get almost full day backup in one single charge. Speakers are loud enough. Amoled display is very bright and beautiful to watch any content on it.",5,MOBHFMG9MKJ6S5ZF

My device got updated from MIUI 14 to HyperOS in the first week of purchase.

Samsung Galaxy-s23,Camera just wow,4,MOBGMFFXDQTGNWVK
Samsung Galaxy-s23,"Camera and overall features are nice. If you are into photography, can download Expert RAW app by Samsung and try to enhance your skills. Night clicks are also coming out quite good. Processor is superfast. Intensive usage is leading to heating but not into an alarming condition. But bit heating is there while you are going all out. Overall size is quite handy which I admire a lot. But the major drawback is the battery which is not upto the mark comparing to I Phone 14.",4,MOBGMFFXDQTGNWVK
Samsung Galaxy-s23,"I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience.

Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue.

Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However,...

Samsung Galaxy-s23,"My review after 2 months - (Honestly suggesting to go for 256gb variant as UFS 4.0 is an absolute deal breaker.)
Slightly overpriced by 5k but THE BEST phone overall in all categories at this price point.

PROS -
1. Cameras - Delightful!!! Videography could be better but no complaints so far. 3x telephoto with OIS is a boon.
2. Performance - No challenge. It's an absolute beast. For stat geeks I tested Geekbench 6 and got a score of 1800 for Single Core
3. Battery life - Not gonna lie ...

Samsung Galaxy-s23,"What struck me at the very beginning is its compactness and light weight. It's so easy to use with one hand. Other than that it remains true to its flagship tag as display, battery, performance are all highly satisfactory. Camera is top notch. Since I have used mobiles from many brands, I rate one UI the best of all in the Android world. It's a wonderful all round device by Samsung . Special thanks to Flipkart for the big discount. I am extremely impressed with the product.",5,MOBGMFFXDQTGNWVK
Samsung Galaxy-s23,"Great grip to hold. Been using it without case and no issues or sense of dropping it.

Glad i chose the 256gb variant, its UFS 4 storage is quite handy in using Samsung Dex (base 128gb variant comes with UFS 3.1).

Camera is good. May not be the best for bright photos, it tends to make it a bit dark. But normal user won't see much difference.

Performance is top notch.

Heating issues exist when charging or while on video calls. If you using a case, it won't be felt much. Won't heat as much...

At the beginning I had a good network of 5G in Jio and Airtel, but after a month now I can't access 5G in both Sim cards. I reached the service centre but they were not professional and genuine. The Nothing service centre is run by Third party service providers. That's why they didn't get properly helped me out. I mai...

Guys believe it's worth buying under 20k but more than that it's not worth it!!

1 - camera needs updates
2 - some glitches are there
3 - not for gamers
4 - need alot in software side
5 - feel premium but cheap material if phone goes down it will crack

But this phone is worth buying if you are buying for your elder ones like mom or dad!!",5,MOBGVMQS9NC2DH2P
